// UNDO SURVIVES A SERVER-SIDE MUTATION. THIS IS THE GATE THAT SAYS SO.
//
// IT WAS A PROBE FOR ONE DAY AND ITS HEADER SAID WHY: the defect was real,
// understood, and deliberately unfixed, and a gate that is permanently red for
// a known design gap trains people to ignore the gate. It also said what would
// change that — "the day targeted mutation lands, this becomes a gate" — and
// that day is this one. It asserts now.
//
// WHAT IT MEASURED WHILE IT WAS A PROBE, on the built binary 2026-08-23:
//
//   control — three edits typed, three undos, nothing filed:
//     back to "Alpha one here."          all three levels recovered
//   test    — same three edits, ONE instruction filed, three undos:
//     "Alpha one here. ONE TWO THREE"    changed at all? false
//
// Court asked "is there only one level of undo?". There was not one — after any
// server-side mutation there were ZERO. Yjs owns undo and the stack was fine;
// it was ORPHANED, because every server-side mutation went through ydoc.Load,
// which deletes the fragment's children and writes them again, so each undo
// entry pointed at items that no longer existed and Cmd-Z was a silent no-op.
// ydoc.Write is the fix: a change that only moves MARKS is formatted in place.
//
// THE CONTROL IS HALF THE GATE AND MUST NOT BE DELETED AS REDUNDANT. Without
// it, "undo did nothing" is equally well explained by a broken keybinding, a
// focus problem, or a harness that never delivered the keystroke — and this
// file would then report the product broken every time playwright changed how
// it sends ⌘Z. The redo between the halves is there for the same reason: it
// proves the stack was still whole at the moment the instruction was filed.
//
// THE PAUSES BETWEEN THE TYPED WORDS ARE LOAD-BEARING. Yjs coalesces edits that
// arrive close together into ONE undo step, so typing three words with no gap
// is one level and the control could not tell one level from three.
