// livestructure.mjs — A STRUCTURAL ROUND CUTS THE PAGE AND RELOADS THE
// REVIEWER, WITHOUT LOSING THE ROUND'S WORDS.
//
// `galley edit page.html` re-extracts the page EVERY round, so the template
// rides the loop instead of being frozen at open (spec: "HTML pages — the
// template rides the loop"). A structural change is then just something the
// agent does while answering: it edits the page's .html, galley re-extracts,
// and the reviewer's live editor RELOADS on the re-derived content.
//
// NO OTHER GATE CAN SEE THIS, AND THE GO TESTS CANNOT SEE THE HALF THAT
// MATTERS MOST. internal/serve/pagemode_test.go drives the whole pipeline —
// merge, reload claim, handoff window, the overlapping-projection races — but
// it asserts against the CRDT in process. It has no browser bound to that
// document, so it cannot say whether the reviewer's EDITOR came back: whether
// the cut prose left the screen, whether the caret survived the replacement,
// whether the next keystroke still lands. page.mjs opens a page-backed review
// but its agent only ever edits content.md; the .html is never touched, so the
// structural path it now guards is never entered. This gate is the only place
// the browser-visible half of the feature is proven. Its four claims:
//
//   THE CUT STAYS CUT, AND THE EDITOR FOLLOWS — the agent deletes a whole
//   <section> from page.html; the re-rendered page has no wrapper and no prose
//   left of it, AND the reviewer's live editor no longer shows that prose. The
//   file half alone would be green with a browser still displaying a document
//   that no longer exists.
//
//   THE EDITOR IS STILL AN EDITOR AFTERWARDS — the reload is a full model
//   replacement (the restore path), which orphans undo and moves the caret. So
//   the reviewer types after it and the keystroke registers, the caret is a
//   real position in the new document rather than a detached one, and undo does
//   not resurrect the section that was cut.
//
//   A RESTRUCTURE DOES NOT EAT THE ROUND'S WORDS (C1) — the agent answers in
//   BOTH layers in one round: a wording change in content.md and a structural
//   edit to page.html. Both survive into the reloaded editor and into the page.
//   This is the failure the internals were fixed for — a reload taken straight
//   off the page replaced the agent's content edits with the page's own words,
//   silently — and a browser bound to the document is where it was visible.
//
//   A CONTENT-ONLY ROUND AFTER ONE DOES NOT CHURN — the next wording round
//   renders and re-extracts to the same split, so it reloads NOTHING. Idem-
//   potence is a Go-side property; "the reviewer's screen did not wobble" is
//   this one. The evidence is mechanical: galley announces every reload on
//   stderr, and that count must not move across a content round.
//
// THE REVIEWER NEVER TOUCHES HTML. Everything the reviewer half does goes
// through the editor and the composer; the .html writes are all the agent's,
// in the agent child. Asserted rather than asserted-by-narration: the reviewer
// half records every path it writes, and the document it is shown is checked
// for page markup that would mean the split leaked.
//
// THE RACES ARE NOT REPRODUCED HERE, DELIBERATELY. The handoff-close TOCTOU,
// overlapping projections and the stale agent page-write are pinned by
// deterministic Go tests with a seam for the interleaving; a browser gate can
// only produce them by luck, and a gate that reports a race by luck is a flake
// with a reputation. This one exercises the ORDINARY sequence end to end.
//
// HOW THE AGENT IS PLAYED. The same shape page.mjs uses: this file re-invoked
// with --agent, blocked on `galley wait`, answering with the CLI verbs and the
// FILE. It answers three rounds in turn — structural, both-layers, content —
// and reports through a JSONL journal so the reviewer half can read its
// progress while it is still blocked. No model, no tokens.
//
// THE RED RUN was done at the source, not with a switch, because the thing to
// break is galley's and not the agent's: making pageRenderer.reload return
// without applying the model (and, separately, making the drift path skip
// merge) turns §2 and §4 red respectively while every file-level check stays
// green — which is the point of asserting the editor and not only the bytes.
//
// Running it:
//
//   just build
//   GALLEY="$PWD/bin/galley" node web/livestructure.mjs
//
// It needs a chromium for playwright to drive: `npx playwright install
// chromium` once, or GALLEY_CHROME=<executable>. There is a `just
// livestructure` recipe, it is in `just gates`, and it is a step of its own in
// ci.yml.
