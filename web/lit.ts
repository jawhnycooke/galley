// LIGHTING THE TEXT — which words is this card about.
//
// THE LINE IS DELETED AND THE WORDS ANSWER INSTEAD. A connector was drawn from
// a card to its mark for two phases and failed twice for one reason: it was
// invented to bridge the gap when a card had DRIFTED from its mark, and it read
// as meaningful only because it was LONG. Once the rail scrolled with the
// document and cards sat beside their text the leg collapsed and what was left
// was a 26px stub crossing 7% of a 376px gutter, ending in empty page. Aimed at
// the card's MIDDLE instead it stopped striking horizontally and began sagging
// diagonally THROUGH the paragraph the reviewer is reading — measured at 250px
// of sag with the card and its mark 0px apart vertically, in the accent, which
// over prose reads as a strike. The gutter is too wide for a line to cross
// without becoming the loudest thing on the page, and the question the line
// answered — *which words is this about* — is answered better by the words
// changing. Court, after a mockup: *"1: light the text is fine."*
//
// IT HAS TO BE A DECORATION, and that is the whole reason this file exists.
// CLAUDE.md: a class on a ProseMirror-rendered element is not yours to keep.
// The obvious implementation — walk `[data-run]` and toggle a class — was what
// `.gly-note` was marked settled with once, and it was measured failing:
// ProseMirror rewrites those elements' attributes from the node on every
// redraw, and a redraw follows every server-side mutation, each of which
// replaces the whole document. The class lands and is wiped a moment later.
//
// The lit set is not in the document and must not be: it is where the pointer
// is. So it arrives as transaction META from the code that watches hover and
// focus, and this plugin holds it as view state — never as content.
