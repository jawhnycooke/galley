// THE CLAIM LIST IS THE SINGLE SOURCE, AND IT LIVES HERE.
//
// This protocol has three carriers — `channelInstructions` (the MCP
// handshake), `agentPromptText` (the CLI cold start), and the plugin skill at
// plugin/galley/skills/reviewing-a-document/SKILL.md. Their PROSE differs by
// design: three media, three reading moments, and the skill is the one a
// paired session actually loads. Their CLAIMS must not differ at all.
//
// Before this file the list was spelled twice — once in agentprompt_test.go
// and once in pluginskill_test.go — while pluginskill_test.go's own header
// argued that a third list is a third thing to drift. Two lists is the same
// bet with better odds. Adding a claim to one did not add it to the others.
//
// Add a claim HERE and every carrier is held to it at once.

	// over none and compliance was impossible — measured 2026-08-22 as 23
	// changes across three rounds carrying `answers` on none of them. The
	// data is there now; these two entries stop a carrier losing the

	// the entire document from the copy in its context, and a section the

	// expansion. Its write was correctly REJECTED with "modified since
	// read"; it re-read five lines to satisfy the tool and wrote the whole
	// file anyway.
	//
	// Telling the agent what the reviewer removed (which the round now does)
