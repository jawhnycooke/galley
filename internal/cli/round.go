// A ROUND IS DELIVERED ONCE, AND UNTIL NOW THERE WAS NO WAY TO READ IT AGAIN.
//
// The instructions reach the agent in the notification `galley wait` prints or
// the channel pushes. After that they are gone: there is no round verb, and
// `wait` blocks for the NEXT one. An agent whose context is compacted mid-round,
// or which restarts, has lost what it was asked to do — and the standing rule
// gives it no fallback, correctly: a sent round is no longer pending, so
// re-reading `galley pending` returns the wrong thing rather than the round.
//
// NOT HYPOTHETICAL. The session that answered the rounds in galley's own first
// real review appears to have restarted mid-review; muster warned "messaging a
// new session for the first time under a previously used name (was it
// restarted?)". The two defects that review found were both about the agent
// acting on something other than what it had been sent.
//
// THE DATA ALREADY EXISTS AND ONLY NEEDED READING. `rounds.jsonl` stores each
// round's `asks` with key, text and quote — exactly what the notification
// renders — because a Change has to be able to point AT an Ask. Nothing is
// captured here and nothing new is stored.
//
// IT RENDERS THROUGH `formatInstructions`, the same function `galley wait` and
// the channel render with, so a re-read and the original cannot drift. That is
// the twin-carrier rule this repository has paid for more than any other: a
// second renderer would agree on the day it was written and disagree on the day
// somebody changed one of them.
//
// REJECTED: `galley pending --round N`. It overloads the one command whose
// entire contract is that pending is LIVE state and a sent round is not
// pending — the exact confusion the rule exists to prevent, spelled into the
// flag set of the command that states it.

// roundFlags is galley round's flag set, built by newRoundFlags so the app
// registry (NewFlags) and runRound share one construction.
