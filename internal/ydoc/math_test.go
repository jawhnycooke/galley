// DISPLAY MATH IS RAW TEXT, AND THE THREE PLACES THAT KNOW THAT HAVE TO AGREE.
//
// The front matter file next door states the rule; this is the second kind
// under it. docmodel.MathBlock carries its content in Block.Text, so writeBlock
// writes it as one unmarked YXmlText run and both readers have to put it back
// in Text rather than in Inlines. A kind added to the writer and one reader
// crosses the bridge and comes back with its content in the wrong field — a
// document the reviewer never touched, projected to disk with the formula gone.
//
// Read and ReadLive are two implementations of one walk, so both are asserted
// against the same model.

// fail — `text*` accepts a childless node and a list item re-indents what it
// holds, and both are where a raw-text kind is actually lost.
