// TestReadLive_RetriesOnAPureDelete is the delete-only counterpart to the

// map the document's own content never touches). A pure delete — the exact
// shape a backspace produces, and the shape the round-2 fix's own bug was
// about — never advances any client's clock (see ReadLive's doc comment:
// probed directly against ygo v1.43.0's Item.delete/buildDeleteSet), so a
// StateVector-only comparison is structurally blind to it: it would report
// "clean" on an attempt where phase 2 had in fact just read a deleted node
// back as empty. This is what forced the move to crdt.CaptureSnapshot's
// StateVector+DeleteSet pair.
//
// The hook here deletes real text from the live document — not a side map —
// on its first call only, then goes quiet. If the snapshot comparison sees
// deletes, ReadLive retries once and its SECOND attempt (now running against
// the already-deleted, otherwise-quiescent document) succeeds with the
// correct post-delete content. If it does not see deletes (the old bug),
// this fails two ways depending on exactly how the race falls: either the
// hook only runs once (no retry triggered) and the result may reflect a torn
// read, or — as a further check independent of call count — the result
// disagrees with an independent plain Read taken right after.
