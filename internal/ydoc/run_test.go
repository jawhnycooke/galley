// RUNS MUST SURVIVE THE CRDT, and this is the only thing that says so.
//
// docmodel.Equal deliberately ignores RunAttr — a run is session identity,
// minted at random and never serialized, so comparing it would make the
// round-trip fixed point unstatable (see Equal). That exclusion means the
// bridge's own round-trip tests, which are all written in terms of Equal, would
// not notice the bridge dropping every run on the floor.
//
// It would matter immediately. suggest.MintRuns is idempotent only because
// marks coming back from ReadLive still carry the runs they went in with; a
// bridge that dropped them would re-mint the whole document on every mutate
// cycle, renumbering the anchor under every open card mid-session. And the run
// is what makes one span in the file one decision after it is loaded, so losing
// it here restores the split this whole line of work removed.
