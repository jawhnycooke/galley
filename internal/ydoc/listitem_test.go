// EVERY LIST ITEM CROSSES THE BRIDGE WITH A PARAGRAPH FIRST, AND EVERY
// BLOCKQUOTE WITH A BLOCK IN IT.
//
// The sibling of TestEveryCellCrossesWithABlockInside, for the rule that is
// STRICTER than block+. TipTap's listItem is `content: 'paragraph block*'` and
// StarterKit's copy is registered unmodified, so an item whose first child is a
// fence, a heading, a blockquote, a nested list, a table, an image, a rule or a
// note — or an item with no children at all, which is what a bare "-" is — is a
// node the browser cannot build. blockquote is `block+`, and a bare ">" is a
// Blockquote goldmark hands back childless.
//
// y-prosemirror does not SKIP such an element. createNodeFromYElement wraps
// schema.node (which is createChecked, and throws) in a try, and the catch
// DELETES the element from the Y doc; the deletion broadcasts, EditServer's
// doc.OnUpdate fires, touch() schedules Project(), and the projection writes the
// shortened document to the author's file with no keystroke. Measured in a real
// chromium against the tracked build: an ordinary numbered install list went
// from 143 bytes to 66, losing both of its commands, and the surviving third
// step was RENUMBERED to "1. done" — a file that still reads as a complete
// one-step procedure.
//
// IT IS DRIVEN FROM Parse RATHER THAN FROM A HAND-BUILT MODEL, for the reason
// the cell test gives: the hand-built model is what agreed with the bug for a
// whole phase. And it walks the FRAGMENT rather than Read's output, because a
// model that round-trips through the bridge can still be a model the browser
// refuses — which is the entire class of bug this guards.
//
// A GO GOLDEN FILE CANNOT SEE ANY OF IT: Serialize is unchanged by the fix, so
// `Serialize(Parse(x)) == x` held for every one of these before it. This test
// and `just schema` are what can fail.
