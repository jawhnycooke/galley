// WRITE APPLIES A MODEL WITHOUT DESTROYING THE DOCUMENT WHEN IT DOES NOT HAVE
// TO, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE OF WHY UNDO WORKS.
//
// `Load` deletes the fragment's children and writes them again. It is correct
// and it is what every server-side mutation used to do, so every one of them
// left the browser's undo stack pointing at items that no longer exist.
// Measured 2026-08-23 in a real chromium (`just undo-probe`): three edits typed,
// three levels of undo recovered with nothing filed — and after ONE instruction
// was filed, three ⌘Z changed the document not at all. Not one level. Zero.
//
// THE OBSERVATION THAT MAKES THE FIX SMALL: of the five server-side mutations,
// three change MARKS ONLY. Filing an instruction adds a highlight over a range,
// deleting one removes it, and sending a round clears them — no prose moves in
// any of the three, and those three are every gesture a reviewer makes while
// reviewing. The other two, restoring a version and importing the agent's
// draft, genuinely replace the document, and resetting undo across them is
// right rather than merely tolerable: there is nothing sensible to ⌘Z across
// "restore v4 as draft".
//
// SO THE DECISION IS MADE FROM THE TWO MODELS AND NOT FROM THE CALL SITE. Write
// compares what it is replacing with what it is writing; if the only difference
// is marks on identical text, it formats those runs in place, and otherwise it
// falls back to Load. Nothing about the callers changed, no caller can forget
// to opt in, and the fallback means the worst case is exactly today's
// behaviour. `EditServer.mutate`'s standing warning — do not attempt targeted
// fragment mutation before phase 3 — is answered rather than ignored: this
// touches no structure at all, and refuses the moment structure moves.
//
// IT REUSES `formatAttrs`, WHICH IS NOT AN ECONOMY. That function returns the
// COMPLETE attribute set for a run — every kind named, nil for the ones that
// are off — which is exactly what `Format` needs in order to both set and clear
// a mark. A second attribute builder here would be this repository's most
// recorded defect: two spellings of one rule, agreeing until the day one of
// them changes.
//
// Returns true when the write was targeted, for tests and for nothing else.
