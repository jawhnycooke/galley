// Package ydoc bridges galley's document model into ygo's XML fragment — the
// shared type TipTap edits through y-prosemirror.
//
// The fragment is the live document. Every name in it is TipTap's: element tags
// are ProseMirror node names ("paragraph", "bulletList", "horizontalRule"),
// element attributes are node attributes, and a mark is a formatting attribute
// on a YXmlText run, keyed by the mark's name. Nothing here is a private
// encoding galley invented; a y-prosemirror client attached to the same
// fragment sees the document it expects.
//
// Three things about ygo's XML surface are load-bearing, all established by
// probe rather than assumed:
//
//   - YXmlText.Insert INHERITS the formatting in effect at the cursor when it
//     is passed nil or empty attributes, and otherwise applies the DIFFERENCE
//     between what it is passed and what is already in effect. Writing a plain
//     run after a bold one with nil attributes silently makes it bold. Every
//     run is therefore written with the complete attribute set — every mark
//     that is off named explicitly with a nil value, which clears it. That set
//     is not a fixed list: a kind nobody named stays switched on, so it spans
//     the marks this package knows about PLUS every kind present in the block,
//     including ones from TipTap extensions it has never heard of. See
//     runKinds.
//
//   - YXmlText positions are UTF-16 code units, exactly as YText's are: "😀" is
//     one rune and two positions. This package never computes an offset. It
//     appends at Len(), which is already in the right units, so there is no
//     opportunity to cut a surrogate pair in half.
//
//   - Reads take the document's read lock (YXmlText.ToString does), and
//     ygo's transaction holds the write lock, which is not reentrant. So Load
//     resolves and measures the fragment BEFORE opening its transaction, and
//     reaches every nested node through the handle that created it. Read runs
//     entirely outside a transaction.
//
// Unlike YMap, YXmlFragment.Children DOES surface nested shared types, so the
// ForEach-skips-nested hazard that shapes internal/review does not apply here.
// It was probed; it does not reproduce on the XML types.
//
// That matters more since phase 1e than it did before. A table is three
// levels of nested elements — table > tableRow > tableCell > paragraph — and
// it is precisely the shape the YMap hazard eats: an attached ForEach walk
// would report zero rows and return a Block with the right kind and no
// content, which projects to disk as a table that lost every cell. Nothing in
// this file uses ForEach, and nothing added to it should. Children() and
// indexed access are what is probed; a walk written any other way is not.

// used where nothing else can be mutating the same *crdt.Doc at that moment
// (tests, one-shot CLI reads of a document nothing is serving).
//
// The hazard: YXmlFragment.Children and YXmlElement.GetAttributes/
// GetAttributeValues take NO lock at all — probed and confirmed against
// v1.43.0 — unlike almost everything else in ygo's XML surface, which either
// takes the document's read lock itself (YXmlText.ToString/ToDelta) or is
// only ever called already holding the write lock (inside a Transact). A
// structural walk of the fragment (Children, recursively) races an Apply
// -driven write's own structural mutations under `go test -race`: both read
// and write the same linked list, and only the writer takes any lock at all.
//
// The fix looks like the CLAUDE.md rule it sits next to — "resolve outside,
// touch the document only inside the transaction" — but is NOT simply
// "wrap Read's body in a Transact": YXmlText.ToString/ToDelta each take the
// document's READ lock, and a Transact holds the WRITE lock for the same
// non-reentrant mutex, on the same goroutine — calling either from inside
// a Transact deadlocks (established by probe; the "never read inside
// Transact" rule again, just for a different pair of ygo calls than the one
// CLAUDE.md already names). So this runs in two phases: PHASE 1, inside one
// Transact, walks the structure only (Children/NodeName/GetAttributes*,
// all lock-free) and snapshots it — capturing each YXmlText node's POINTER
// rather than its content. PHASE 2, after the Transact has released the
// write lock, reads that content (ToString/ToDelta, each taking their own
// brief read lock, safe again now).
//
// That split reopens a narrower window of its own: a peer write landing
// between phase 1 capturing a YXmlText's pointer and phase 2 reading through
// it can delete the very node phase 1 pointed at. ToString/ToDelta do not
// error on a deleted node — by design, a Y.Text tombstone reads as empty —
// so phase 2 would silently materialise a Block with the right shape but
// missing text: a heading snapshot mid-delete reads back as "" instead of
// its actual content, and Project would write "#" to disk where "# Title"
// belongs. Not a data race (every access here is properly lock-protected;
// -race has nothing to flag) and not a crash — a quiet, textually-valid
// wrong answer, which is worse. Found by fuzzing the exact interleaving:
// racing Apply-driven reloads against Project while polling the file on
// disk surfaced hundreds of empty-heading writes in tens of thousands of
// iterations.
//
// The guard is a validated snapshot: crdt.CaptureSnapshot(doc) before phase 1
// opens and again after phase 2 finishes reading every captured pointer,
// compared with crdt.EqualSnapshots. A Yjs Snapshot is a StateVector PLUS a
// DeleteSet — that second half is load-bearing and not optional here: a pure
// delete (the exact shape a backspace produces, and the shape this whole bug
// is about) marks an item's Deleted flag and records the range in the
// transaction's delete set, but never advances any client's clock — probed
// directly against v1.43.0 (crdt/item.go's delete, crdt/store.go's
// buildDeleteSet). So a StateVector-only comparison, an earlier version of
// this guard, is STRUCTURALLY BLIND to a delete-only interleaving: it
// reported "clean" while phase 2 had in fact just read a deleted node back
// as empty. CaptureSnapshot's DeleteSet catches exactly that, confirmed by
// the same kind of probe: capture, run a pure YXmlText.Delete with nothing
// inserted, capture again — StateVector compares equal, EqualSnapshots does
// not.
//
// Like StateVector, CaptureSnapshot takes the document's own write lock to
// compute — no separate deferred callback (an OnUpdate subscription, say)
// that could still be pending when the check runs, just a direct,
// immediately-consistent read of the same store every writer mutates under
// that same lock. If the two snapshots disagree, some write (insert OR
// delete) landed somewhere in the interval and the whole two-phase read is
// discarded and retried — the comparison window is deliberately wider than
// the strictly vulnerable one (it also starts ticking before phase 1 opens,
// not just between the phases), which costs a few avoidable retries when a
// write lands harmlessly before phase 1 even starts, in exchange for having
// no window of its own to reason about. A clean comparison means no write —
// of either shape — could have interleaved with the reads that produced this
// Doc, by construction, not by getting lucky on timing.
