// renderTable writes a GFM table in ONE canonical spelling, which is a pure
// function of the cells' content.
//
// That sentence is the entire fixed-point argument, and it is why the
// document model carries no column WIDTH at all. The obvious alternative —
// pad every column to its widest cell — is stable against itself and
// unusable in practice: every table a human has ever written reflows on the
// first save, so a reviewer who opens a document and types one character in
// the prose produces a diff touching every row of every table below it. The
// table in galley's own design spec, the document this phase exists to open,
// is written in the form below and comes back out of it byte-identical.
//
// So widths are normalized by not existing. Parse discards the author's
// spacing because there is nowhere in the model to put it, and this writes
// " | " separators and three-character delimiters whatever the content is.
//
// Two normalizations happen HERE rather than in the model, because the file
// has only one place to say either. Every row is written with the HEADER's
// column count — GFM pads a short row and drops a long row's extras, and
// goldmark already does that on parse, so a document that came from Parse is
// unchanged and only a hand-built ragged one moves. And the delimiter row's
// alignment is read from the header row's cells alone, since the delimiter
// row is the only line that can carry it.

// escapeCellText makes a rendered cell safe to sit inside a "| ... |" row.
// Two invariants, and the format dies without either.
//
// A ROW IS ONE LINE. Any newline reaching here splits the row and turns the
// rest of the cell into another row — or, past the last row, into a
// paragraph. dropHardBreaks removes the one source Parse can produce; this is
// the backstop for the rest (a code span holding a raw newline, a fence
// flattened above), and it is a backstop rather than the only guard because a
// stray "\\" left in front of the newline would survive as a literal
// backslash in the file.
//
// AN UNESCAPED "|" SPLITS THE CELL. GFM resolves a row into cells BEFORE any
// inline parsing, so the escape belongs on the cell's whole rendered text —
// including inside a code span, whose content the inline escaper deliberately
// never touches because markdown gives no way to escape it. That is not a
// workaround: the GFM spec says a pipe may be included "by escaping it,
// including inside other inline spans", and goldmark implements exactly that
// (its escapedPipeCell transformer splits the span around the backslash and
// drops it). Parse's own unescape covers the ordinary case for free, since
// "|" is CommonMark ASCII punctuation.
//
// Escaping every pipe unconditionally is correct because this package emits
// no pipe of its own — no delimiter it writes is a "|" — so every pipe
// arriving here is content.
