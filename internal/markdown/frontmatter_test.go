// FRONT MATTER IS THE ONE CONSTRUCT GALLEY NEITHER MODELLED NOR REFUSED.
//
// Measured on the tracked build (8a78350), `galley accept --all` over a file
// nobody had touched:
//
//	---                          ---
//	title: The Spec        ->
//	status: draft                ## title: The Spec status: draft owner: court
//	owner: court
//	---
//
// Four lines became one H2 heading and the closing delimiter was deleted. The
// cause was that goldmark was built with the Table and Footnote extensions
// only, so the opening "---" was a THEMATIC BREAK and the keys under it were a
// SETEXT HEADING underlined by the closing "---" — a reading in which nothing
// is unsupported, so the refusal machinery that protects footnotes, raw HTML,
// link references and mixed images never fired.
//
// Every offline write verb did it (accept --all, reject, decline, approve
// --all, suggest), and so did opening the document in a browser, because they
// all reach the file through Parse and Serialize.
//
// These assert the fix's whole contract: the block is MODELLED, it is carried
// BYTE-IDENTICALLY, and the fixed point Parse(Serialize(Parse(x))) == Parse(x)
// survives — including for the shapes where a "---" is NOT front matter.

// frontMatterCases are documents whose bytes must survive Parse -> Serialize
// unchanged. Byte identity is the assertion that matters here: front matter is
// metadata galley does not model the INSIDE of, so anything but the author's
// own bytes is a rewrite of a file nobody edited.
