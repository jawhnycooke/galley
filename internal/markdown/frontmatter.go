// FRONT MATTER IS SCANNED HERE RATHER THAN PARSED BY GOLDMARK, and the choice
// is deliberate twice over.
//
// goldmark has no front matter extension in its own tree — the ones that exist
// are third-party — and every one of them PARSES the YAML or TOML into a map.
// galley has nothing to do with what is inside the block: it is metadata, not
// prose, there is no suggestion to make about it and no card to draw for it.
// What galley needs is the two facts a scanner can give and a parser throws
// away: WHERE the block ends, and EXACTLY WHICH BYTES it occupies.
//
// So the block is carried verbatim. Serialize writes back the author's own
// bytes rather than a re-emission of a decoded document, which is the only way
// a key order, a comment, an anchor, a block scalar's indentation or a trailing
// space survives a file being opened. A YAML round trip through a decoder is
// not byte-identical and could not be made so.
//
// THE DELIMITERS ARE PART OF Text. They are the author's bytes too, they are
// what makes the block recognisable when it is read back, and holding them
// means Serialize is a copy rather than a reconstruction — there is no second
// spelling of "---" for the two sides to disagree about.

// SplitFrontMatter returns the file's front matter block, verbatim, and the
// rest of the source. raw is nil when the file has none, in which case rest is
// src unchanged.
//
// The rules are the strict reading, and each one is load-bearing:
//
//   - IT MUST BE AT BYTE 0. Jekyll, Hugo and Astro all agree, and it is what
//     keeps a "---" anywhere else in the file a thematic break.
//   - THE OPENER AND THE CLOSER ARE THE SAME MARKER. "---" is not closed by
//     "+++"; a file that opens one and never closes it has no front matter at
//     all, and its first line goes back to being the thematic break it is
//     today.
//   - THE BODY MUST HOLD SOMETHING. An empty block carries no metadata, and
//     the emptiness is what keeps this a FIXED POINT: Serialize writes a
//     thematic break as "---", so a document opening with two of them is
//     written "---\n\n---\n", which this would otherwise read back as one
//     front matter block and two blocks would be gone. Serialize guards the
//     non-empty case (see frontMatterHazard); this rule is what makes the
//     common case need no guard at all.
