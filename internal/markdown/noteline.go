// noteline.go implements the half of note.go's grammar the reader was missing.
//
// note.go states the discriminator: a {>>…<<} is BLOCK-level exactly when it is
// "the whole content of its LINE" — that is what makes "text. {>>why?<<}" a
// range comment and "{>>why?<<}" on its own line a comment on the block above.
// extractCritic implemented a narrower rule, "the whole content of its
// PARAGRAPH", and every near-miss fell through to the out-of-band lifting path,
// which REMOVES the note from the file. Two of the shapes it missed are things
// a hand-editor types without thinking:
//
//	"para\n{>>note<<}\n"       -> "para\n"   the note is gone
//	"{>>one<<}\n{>>two<<}\n"   -> "\n"       both are gone, the paragraph too
//
// Whether a reviewer's words survived depended on whether they pressed Enter
// twice. So this is not "recognise one more shape" — the next near-miss would
// delete too. The rule is the one the design already stated, applied to the
// unit it was always about:
//
//	A SOURCE LINE inside a paragraph whose content is nothing but notes
//	becomes its own block, one Note per note on it.
//
// Everything else is untouched. A line that mixes prose and notes keeps its
// notes as range comments at their offsets, which is correct and is what
// TestNote_InlineNoteAtEndOfParagraphIsNotADocumentComment pins.
//
// It runs in the CONVERTER rather than in critic.go because a line boundary is
// something only the converter can still see. A soft line break becomes a
// space in the model, deliberately — a paragraph reflows — and by the time
// critic.go runs, "para\n{>>note<<}" and "para {>>note<<}" are the same
// document. They must not become the same block.

// splitNoteLines rewrites one converted block into the blocks its source lines
// describe: a paragraph holding note-only lines becomes those notes as
// paragraphs of their own, with the prose around them rejoined.
//
// softBreaks are rune offsets into b's concatenated text where the source had
// a soft line break; hard breaks are already in the model as a HardBreak
// inline. Both are line boundaries here.
//
// Returns b unchanged — the same slice header, no copy — whenever there is
// nothing to split, which is every block in a document that has no note-only
// line folded into a paragraph.
