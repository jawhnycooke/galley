// THREE DIALECTS THAT ARE ONE PARAGRAPH TO COMMONMARK, AND ARE REFUSED RATHER
// THAN REFLOWED.
//
// A soft line break becomes a space (parse.go's KindText case). That is
// DELIBERATE for prose — a hard-wrapped paragraph reflows, and the README says
// so — and it destroys a construct whose meaning is carried by the line breaks.
// Four dialects were measured doing exactly that on the tracked build, with one
// `galley suggest` and no keystroke:
//
//	Apple                             Apple : A fruit that grows on trees.
//	: A fruit that grows on trees.
//
//	:::note                           :::note This is a body. It has two lines. :::
//	This is a body.
//	It has two lines.
//	:::
//
//	> [!NOTE]                         > [!NOTE] Useful information.
//	> Useful information.
//
//	$$                                $$ E = mc^2 $$
//	E = mc^2
//	$$
//
// The fourth is MODELLED — see math.go — and these three are REFUSED, and the
// discriminator between the two answers is whose language the content is in.
// TeX is not markdown: there is no prose inside display math to review, no mark
// to hang on it and nothing galley could be right or wrong about, so carrying
// the bytes verbatim costs the reviewer nothing. These three hold ORDINARY
// MARKDOWN PROSE — a definition, an admonition's body, a callout's sentence —
// and carrying THAT verbatim would make the author's own sentences literal
// text: unsuggestable, unhighlightable, invisible to `suggest.List`, drawn as a
// preformatted blob. That is a second silent harm wearing the first one's
// clothes. A refusal names the construct and the line, the way footnotes and
// raw HTML are named, and destroys nothing.
//
// EVERY TEST HERE IS EXACT, because a false refusal is a document that will not
// open. A definition list needs a line beginning ":" and a space; a directive
// needs a line beginning ":::"; a callout needs the blockquote's FIRST line to
// be a bare "[!WORD]". Ordinary prose does not spell any of those.

// refuseDialect reports a paragraph written in one of the three line-break
// dialects, or nil.
//
// It is asked of every Paragraph and TextBlock, before any inline is converted,
// because the evidence is the SOURCE LINES and those are gone the moment the
// soft breaks become spaces.
