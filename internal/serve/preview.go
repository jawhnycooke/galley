// preview.go serves the LIVE page and its assets to the split-pane preview
// iframe. Where serveSibling (editassets.go) exists so a markdown figure
// resolves, this exists so a page under review renders as itself: the reviewer
// sees page.html with its stylesheets, scripts, fonts and images, re-fetched
// after every projection.
//
// It reuses serveSibling's containment WHOLESALE, because the threat is the
// same: the page's directory is also, very often, a source tree, and the port
// is a fixed default any web page in the user's browser can reach. So:
//
//   - GET AND HEAD ONLY. A 404 for anything else, not a 405 — a refusal and
//     an absence are byte-identical, so the route never confirms it exists.
//   - INSIDE THE PAGE'S DIRECTORY, enforced by the KERNEL. Every read goes
//     through EditServer.pageRoot, an *os.Root opened once at construction
//     (see NewEditPage). os.Root re-resolves each component at open time, so
//     traversal and symlink escape are refused without string arithmetic.
//   - THE FILE ITSELF IS NOT A SYMLINK — Lstat, then Open through the root,
//     both checked for a regular file, exactly as serveSibling does.
//   - AN EXTENSION ALLOWLIST, not a denylist — previewTypes. A page legitimately
//     references more kinds of file than a figure does (css, js, fonts, source
//     maps), so the allowlist is wider than assetTypes, but it is still an
//     allowlist: an unknown extension is a 404, never served as an arbitrary
//     type.
//
// This route is only live in page mode; in markdown mode s.pageRoot is nil and
// every request here is a 404 like any other absence.

// previewTypes is the allowlist for the preview: extension -> Content-Type. It
// is wider than assetTypes because a page references its own stylesheets,
// scripts, fonts and source maps, not only figures. Keys are lower-case; the
// lookup folds the request's extension to match. An unknown extension is a 404
// — this never serves an arbitrary type.
