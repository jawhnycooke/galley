// manifest.go validates THE AGENT'S TESTIMONY about a round it just landed.
//
// THE SERVER OWNS THE CHANGE LIST; THE AGENT MAY ONLY ANNOTATE IT. What
// changed between the version the agent was handed and the file it left behind
// is computed here, by internal/diff, exactly as it is computed everywhere else
// — the agent's manifest may not declare a change, only comment on one that the
// diff already found. That is the whole rule, and both checks below are it:
//
//   - the QUOTE, normalised the way the diff normalises, must fall inside
//     EXACTLY ONE changed region. Not "at least one": a locator that lands in
//     two regions cannot say which change its note is about, and guessing which
//     is the one thing this file exists to refuse.
//   - every key in ANSWERS must be one the server actually sent that round.
//     The instruction's thread is deleted by the send that carried it, so the
//     keys live on the round record (versions.Round.Asks) and nowhere else.
//
// AN ENTRY FAILING EITHER CHECK IS DROPPED, AND THE ROUND STILL LANDS. The
// change renders anyway — with no ask line and no note, which is the rendering
// an unattributed change already gets — and the drop count is logged so a
// mis-shaped manifest is visible rather than silent. It is deliberately NOT an
// error return: CLAUDE.md's "AN ERROR RETURN IS AN INVITATION, and the ledger's
// whole invariant is that nobody accepts it" cuts straight against making a
// round's landing contingent on the agent's own bookkeeping. The agent's work
// is in the file either way; its notes about that work are not worth failing
// the landing over.
//
// NOTHING HERE IS STORED AS A DIFF. What survives is versions.Change — the
// agent's own quotation and its own sentence, neither of which is derivable
// from the two documents — and the quotation is re-matched against a freshly
// computed diff every time a reading state renders it.
