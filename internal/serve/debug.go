// debug.go is edit mode's half of the opt-in diagnostic record — what this
// server handed the agent, what came back, what it refused, what it cut, and
// whether anybody was listening.
//
// THE SURFACE IS METHODS THAT RETURN NOTHING, for internal/ledger's reason
// stated a second time: an error return is an invitation, and a call site that
// propagated one would turn a full disk into a refused Revise press. There is
// no error here to check, so no handler can be written to check it. The rest —
// the bounded queue, the goroutine, the recover — is internal/debug's.
//
// OFF COSTS ONE NIL CHECK. debug.Log's first line returns on a nil sink, and
// every payload below is built from values already in hand, so nothing here is
// worth guarding with debug.On() except a payload that would have to be
// COPIED to be recorded (the ack manifest is the only one, and it is small).
