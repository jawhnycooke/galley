// ReviewerChange is one thing the reviewer changed in the document BY HAND,
// as distinct from an instruction they wrote about it.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS, measured rather than supposed. On 2026-08-22 a reviewer
// deleted a section in round 3 and the agent's round 4 put it back inside an
// 8k expansion. The version history proves the deletion worked: the section is
// absent from v3, the round the reviewer sent, and present again in v4, the
// agent's landing. The agent had no way to know — the round notification it
// received carried only instructions, and closed by telling it not to read
// `galley pending`.
//
// AND THE TRAIL IT WOULD HAVE READ THERE DOES NOT EXIST. `PendingView` had no
// changes field; the `/_galley/trail` route the browser's own
// `SerializedTrailEntry` type documents is in no Go file; and `trailChanges`
// is a doc comment with no function under it. The reviewer's hand edits were
// published to nothing, so this is not "the notification omits what pending
// has" — nothing had it.
//
// COMPUTED FROM TWO VERSIONS, NEVER FROM THE BROWSER'S GHOSTS. The trail in
// `web/trail.ts` deliberately REFUSES to place a ghost it cannot anchor
// unambiguously — correct for anchoring, where a wrong mark is worse than a
// missing one, and fatal here, because a refused ghost would be an unreported
// deletion. A document diff cannot refuse. It also makes the reviewer's side
// symmetric with the agent's, where the contract already says galley owns the
// computed list and the agent's entries only annotate it.

	// Key ADDRESSES ONE CHANGE, and it is derived from content rather than
	// position. The list is recomputed on every poll, so an ordinal would
	// renumber the moment an earlier edit was reverted — this repository's
	// oldest rule, and the card holding a stale one would revert the wrong
	// passage. Two identical changes are genuinely one thing to this key, and
	// reverting either is the same act.
	//

	// (it is told what moved, not asked to undo it), and a key on that payload
	// would be a field nobody reads.
	Key string `json:"key,omitempty"`

// there were rather than silently stopping — a truncation nobody is told about
// reads as "that is all of them", which is the failure this repository records
// under silent caps.

// ledger's reason: a read-only checkout must not turn a Revise press into an
// error page. The cost of returning nothing is an agent told less than it
// could have been; the cost of returning an error is a review that stops.
