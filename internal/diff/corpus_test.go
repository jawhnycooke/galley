// The full sweep needs somebody else's git history and cannot run in CI, so on
// its own it would leave the numbers this design rests on unguarded on every
// ordinary push. These five pairs are real revisions of this repository's own
// markdown, carried into testdata so `just verify` measures them: four are the
// cases the spike's artifact was built from, and the fifth is the worst
// paragraph in the whole corpus — the 1,486-word CLAUDE.md entry the spec names
// as the case that does not reach one and never will.
//
// THE NUMBERS ARE THE ASSERTION. A port that reads well and counts differently
// is a different algorithm, and only a pinned count can say so.
