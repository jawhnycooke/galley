# Security

## Reporting a vulnerability

Mail **court@subaud.io** with `galley security` in the subject. Please do not open a public issue for anything in the list below.

Say what you found, how to reproduce it, and what you think it lets someone do. A proof of concept helps but is not required. You will get a reply within a few days; if you do not, assume the mail went astray and send it again.

There is no bounty programme. There is one maintainer, and disclosures are handled by hand.

## What is in scope, and what a report is worth

galley is a local tool. It runs on your machine, serves a review page on `127.0.0.1`, and the binary never contacts a server — so the interesting surface is not a hosted one.

**Most valuable, in order:**

1. **Document corruption or data loss** — galley writes to files you asked it to review. A path that loses an author's words, writes outside the document's directory, or corrupts a document on a save is a serious bug even when nobody is attacking.
2. **The local server** — the review page is bound to loopback. Anything that exposes it beyond the machine, lets another local process drive somebody else's review, or executes content from a document is in scope. Note that `--on-revise` and `--on-settle` run a shell command **by design**, configured by whoever launched the editor; that is a feature, not a finding.

galley has no license key, no gate, and no signing key: it is free under 25 people and licensed by one-time purchase above that, enforced by the license terms rather than by any technical control. There is therefore no "licence forgery" or "gate bypass" surface — the binary never verifies a key and never withholds a feature.

**Out of scope:** running the software outside the license terms (that is a licensing matter, not a technical control); and anything requiring an attacker who already has write access to your filesystem or your `~/.config`.
